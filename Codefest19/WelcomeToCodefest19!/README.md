Oh this is gonna be a nice easy intro flag! Wont even need a writeup... WRONG.
While not exactly "hard", definitly the hardest intro challenge I've ever done.


Attempting to join their telegram group as they desire pops up the flag "CodefestCTF{G3t_r3ady_" and the message:

```
The other half of the flag was uploaded on the contest page yesterday by accident. It has now been removed. Can you find it?
```

So since I regularily use the Internet WayBack Machine to see old saves of webpages this was not insanely far fetched for me, 
but I understand if this turned off some potential CTFers.


I just went to (https://www.hackerrank.com/codefest19-ctf) and clicked "First Version" to show the 2nd half of the flag as f0r_C0def3stCTF-8fb34fjr4bs43ur8}
(See codefest.png)


This makes the full flag as CodefestCTF{G3t_r3ady_f0r_C0def3stCTF-8fb34fjr4bs43ur8}, now that's a long flag.
