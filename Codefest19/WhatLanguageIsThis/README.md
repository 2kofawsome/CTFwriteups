Downloading this file returns the "decode this" file.
And it contains a series of "iisdsiiioiiiiii" repeated for ~800 charcaters, wow thats long

A Google search for the first few characters in quotes "iiisdsiiio" returns a stackexchange (https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/questions/40124/short-deadfish-numbers/40264) for something called dead fish?
Wow look at that! Its one of those weird hard to read programming languages, and there us a interpreter here (https://www.dcode.fr/deadfish-language)


Putting in the string and decoding to ASCII Characters returns CodefestCTF{Welc0me_t0_C0defest19}


Looks like a flag to me!
