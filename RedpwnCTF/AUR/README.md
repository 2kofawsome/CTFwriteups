A quick google search of the Arch User Repository or AUR shows that its a community maintained group of files or soemthing? maybe? I don't know and don't really care, I just want a flag.

The main [site](https://aur.archlinux.org/) lead me to this package search [page](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/?SB=l&SO=d),
in which I made a few seraches such as redpwn (no results) and flag (wayyyy too many results).

But then I ntoiced something very important, the search by maintainer/co-maintainer field, this is it.
Since the challenege was written by arinerron I searched that up and 4 things showed up, game-git, onionr-git, pfc-git, and lazypkg-git.


A quick look at the 4 show that one of [them](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/game-git/) was edited on the day the challenge went live, this is looking good 
After a bit of snooping I found the "view changes" button, and surprise! [One](https://aur.archlinux.org/cgit/aur.git/commit/?h=game-git&id=7cd93efd62fb4bcd6d1233caa92107a32078b52e) was called "add flag"


Then in this link there was the flag, flag{w0w-have_fun_in-g4m3!}

A quick and easy 50 points, and some shameless promotion of this creators game
