# Dunce Crypto

'''Dunce Crypto

Written by: blevy

Emperor Caesar encrypted a message with his record-breaking high-performance encryption method. You are his tax collector that he is trying to evade. Fortunately for you, his crown is actually a dunce cap.

mshn{P_k0ua_d4ua_a0_w4f_tf_ahe3z}'''

Given the mshn{blahblahblah} format and the obvious mention of "Emperor Caesar" it is clear that it is a caesar cipher here.
And since a shift of 7 on flag{blahblah} would create mshn{blahblah} I just put the ciphertext through https://www.dcode.fr/caesar-cipher with a shift of 7,
and voila flag{I_d0nt_w4nt_t0_p4y_my_tax3s}
