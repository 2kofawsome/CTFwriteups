This was a really fun challenge, and surprisingly not many had solved so it was worth more points (212)

It started with an image "picture.png", this appears to be some kind of chemical compound, organic with mostly C and H (thanks gr12 chem).
a quick google search returns "love" which lead me on a long path of looking at endorphins like dopamine, seratonin, oxytocin, none of which were the solution.


That wild goose chase might have eben why tehre are so few solves, going back to the google search and scrolling down a bit leads to blankets, mugs, and stickers with some artistic designs on them,
but exploring cafepress.com a bit more, and specifically the [chemistry formulas stickers](https://www.cafepress.com/+chemistry-formulas+stickers) section starts to shwo somethign very promising.

There are some stickers with very very similar images that have large names on them, could this be a reference to"this picture has a name"?
And they say MolecularShirts.com! It definitly is!

Heading to that [site](MolecularShirts.com) we can explore "Your Name in Molecules!" and the "I don't get it" section under "More".
[Don't get it](http://www.molecularshirts.com/dont-get-it/) explains everything about how these are named, and there are many examples on [Your name in molecules](http://www.molecularshirts.com/your-name-in-molecules/).

I then manually decoded the image using the charts on [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_standard_amino_acids).
Starting with the O due to its unique shape, then the Rs, then the M due to the only sulfur and the N due to the unique CONH2. _(follow along with the image and the wikipedia)_


I now had  _R_RMS_RON_, a bit mroe fine tuning and looking around at examples on the [Your name in molecules](http://www.molecularshirts.com/your-name-in-molecules/) section revealed the rest.
now I had the flag{drarmstrong}, and there was even this exact one on [Your name in molecules](http://www.molecularshirts.com/your-name-in-molecules/) (I wonder why it didn't show up on google search?)

Really fun challenge, my favorite, and it was nice for the 212 points when 8 of my completed challenges gave only 50.
